        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Overview of Wireframing</h3>
            <p>
                Wireframing is an essential step in UX/UI design that allows designers to visualize the layout and structure of an application before implementing detailed designs. 
                It serves as a blueprint, focusing on <strong>functionality, layout, and user flow</strong> without distractions like colors, fonts, or images.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this project, <strong>low-fidelity wireframes</strong> were created to outline the core features of the <strong>Health Companion Super App</strong>, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Home Screen:</strong> Displays an overview of medication schedules, upcoming appointments, and recent notifications.</li>
                <li><strong>Medication Reminder Screen:</strong> Allows users to view, edit, and log their medication intake.</li>
                <li><strong>Appointment Scheduling Screen:</strong> Enables users to book, reschedule, and view past and upcoming doctor appointments.</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications Screen:</strong> Displays medication and appointment reminders.</li>
